PizzaJiggle

This is version one of one of my personal projects. It is a simple image uploader that will return the image "cartoonified" (via Cloudinary) and then waving via a Three.js shader.

The three.js shader in this project is made possible thanks to https://tympanus.net/codrops/2020/03/17/create-a-wave-motion-effect-on-an-image-with-three-js/.
